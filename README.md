# Alexa portfolio

Everything lives in this one folder:

- **index.html** — open this in your browser to preview the site
- **README.md** — this file
- **Your images** — put all image files here (same folder as index.html). Use the same filenames as in the site (e.g. `alexa_headshot.jpg`, `1marianafashiondesign_proj9.jpg`, `2secretlifeofwalter_proj1.jpg`, etc.)

**Photography:** Click “photography” in the nav → scroll in any direction → click any image to see the description and other images from that shoot → “← back” returns to the grid.

All future edits will be made to **index.html** in this folder so everything stays in one place.
